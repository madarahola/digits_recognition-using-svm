# Digits_recognition using support vector machine learning algorithm.

This is my First Machine learning project.

This project is to show how we can use machine learning algorithm to classify the digits without using any image processing library. Here I have used Kernel RBF SVM machine learning algorithm. You can try with other machine learning algorithm and predict the results with different accuracy.
