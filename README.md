# Digits_recognition using support vector machine learning algorithm.

This is my First Machine learning project.

This project is to show how we can use machine learning algorithm to classify the digits without using any image processing library or deep learning algorithm. Here I have used Kernel RBF SVM machine learning algorithm however accuracy is somewhat 76 % .You can try with other machine learning algorithm and predict the results with different accuracy and improve the machine learning model by using gradient boosting or k-fold cross validation.
However web app of this project is still under maintainance. For testing this project in your desktop you can follow these steps.

1.Install all the libararies in python. I would recommend to install anaconda package and evironment as it comes with preinstalled libraries.
2.Open temp.py. In this python script you will see location of image. Open paint and fix some particular resolution of paint. Paint background with black and draw digit with white color. Save the image and then add the image location in temp.py set location of picture you saved. Run temp.py . You will see the output of the image that you draw.
3.If you want to draw another digit. Draw digit in paint and save again. Run the python script. You will see the output.
