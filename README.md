# Digits_recognition using support vector machine learning algorithm.

This is my First Machine learning project.

This project is to show how we can use machine learning algorithm to classify the digits without using any image processing library or deep learning algorithm. Here I have used Kernel RBF SVM machine learning algorithm however accuracy is somewhat 76 % .You can try with other machine learning algorithm and predict the results with different accuracy and improve the machine learning model by using gradient boosting or k-fold cross validation.
However wep app of this project is still under maintainance
